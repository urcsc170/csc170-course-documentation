# Lab 0: Course Tools

*Due: Tuesday, February 2, 2021* 

Your assignment is to simply be aware of how we'll communicate this semester, and to setup your access to our "Slack Workspace"

## A Quick Poll

First of all, answer a few questions just to see what we're working with this semester: 

- [CSC 170 Polling Questions (Google Poll)](https://forms.gle/XziMiuBseRwTzERX8)

...then come back here to continue.

## The Course Documentation website

The "Course Documentation" website (where you're reading these instructions now) will be the *plan of record* for the entire semester.  Everything we cover, including all assignments, links to videos, and PDFs of PowerPoint slides, will appear there.

So bookmark this address and check it often: [docs.csc170.org](https://docs.csc170.org)

Also note, whenever something important is added to the Course Documentation website, you'll see an announcement in the [#announcements channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T01HQCN33FX/C01J64BR073)

## The CSC 170 Workspace in Slack

Slack is an industry-standard communications tool that many technology companies use to help their employees work together even if they work in different locations and different time-zones.  (Surprisingly appropriate for us at UR these days!)  So instead of using Blackboard, we will use Slack for CSC 170 to keep everyone focused and coordinated.  

In CSC 170, you will use slack to:

- See what's new and what you should be working on at any given time with links to the Course Documentation website (#announcements)
- Get help with anything on which you're working (#help)
- Discuss anything in a threaded chat room-like environment - including posting jokes (#chatter)
- Setup *private* study groups to stay in communication with whomever you want (private channels can be setup on the fly and then include only people you want to chat with, privately)

BTW - we'll use Blackboard for submitting assignments and checking your grades only

### Step 1: Create your Slack account for CSC 170

We will use Slack as our primary way to keep in contact with each other, and you'll use Slack to get technical help in lieu of attending an in-person lab

- Go to [join.slack.com/t/csc170/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/csc170/signup) and setup your account (if you haven't already)
  - Note: in your profile, there are two places to enter your name: your "Full Name" and your "Display Name."  In at least one of those, you need to match whatever is listed in the official registrar so the professor and TAs can find your grades in Blackboard.

### Step 2: Introduce Yourself 

Also you need to introduce yourself to the other students in CSC 170 because it's beneficial to work in groups.  Although you'll be turning-in all your assignments and projects individually, when we get into more difficult topics like webpage design it's okay to work in groups, so it's important to know who's who.

The best study groups are made of students with technical skills that compliment each other, so that's why you should get to know the other students in CSC 170.

*<u>BE AWARE OF THIS: how to write multiple lines in a Slack message</u>*<br>*You'll notice when creating a message (a post) in Slack, every time you press the Enter key the message is submitted which sends a notification to everyone in that channel! So the channel will get very noisy if you don't remember the following:*

- **To create a new line** while writing a message, press **SHIFT-**ENTER (not just Enter)!!!

*<u>Introduce Yourself</u>*

- Go to the **#chatter** channel in the CSC 170 Slack Workspace
- Create a new message to introduce yourself; write whatever you want; minimally:
  - Your nickname, or how you like to be referred to if different from your *display name* in Slack
  - Your major(s), minor(s), et cetera
  - Any clubs or teams to which you belong
  - Your abilities in any of the following, which will be important to know later in CSC 170:
    - Previous experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (not counting website builder tools like Wix, Squarespace, etc.)
    - Graphic design including photography
    - Other technical/computer skills
  - ...be sure to list courses you're taking or have taken related to these things^

## FTP Account on Our Class Web Server

During a regular, in-person semester you would meet with a TA in your scheduled lab, in-person.  There you would setup your FTP (File Transfer Protocol) account that you will use all semester long to upload your assignment files to our class web server.  

Since CSC 170 is now a 100% online class this semester we need to do things differently, so...

- Stand by for further instructions regarding how to setup your FTP account; there will be an announcement in Slack in the next few days
