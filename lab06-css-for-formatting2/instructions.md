# Lab 6 – CSS for Formatting, part 2
*Due: Monday, June 7, 2021*

The purpose of this lab is to take what you've learned in CSS and experiment with it so you end-up with a completely different looking webpage. Feel free to create your own design. Your work will not be graded on its aesthetic value, however whatever you do, all the content must still be usable and readable.

Also, do *not* try to position elements on your webpage yet.  We'll cover that in the next topic and lab assignment.  For now, just focus on things like:

- "the box model," borders, margin, padding
- colors, text and backgounds
- fonts, sizes, styles, weights, and font-families

## Step 1: Make a copy of Lab 5

-   After you’ve completed Lab 5 make a copy of all the files in it to a new folder named **lab06**

## Step 2: Change/Add styles to your webpage using CSS

For this lab, most of the work you do will be in the **styles.css** file. You will edit the HTML file only to add classes to elements as needed. You may also edit the HTML file to add non-semantic elements like DIVs and SPANs as needed too ...but you should always try to use more, semantically relevant tags before you resort to DIV or SPAN.

General instructions to keep in mind while you create your new design:

-   You must continue to use CSS correctly, placing all styles in a separate, external file that is connected to the HTML document using the LINK tag. 
-   There must be no embedded or inline styles, or incorrectly used HTML elements or attributes in the HTML document.
-   Do not alter the *Normal Document Flow* at this time!  (We'll do that in Lab 7)

Bare minimums:

-   Change **colors**, **font-stacks**, **sizes**, anything, but make sure any changes you make, make sense. I.e., don't change a margin or padding from 15px to 500px (that'd be weird). Continue to keep in mind: readability and usability.
-   Among other selectors, you must create and use **at least three CSS classes**
-   Among other selectors, you must create and use at least **two different kinds of CSS pseudo classes** 
    -   You can use `:hover` on an `a` (anchor) tag, but NO other `a`-type pseudo class (because they're boring and uncommon)
    -   Use the other types of pseudo classes (see this article or google for other examples: [https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/](https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/))
-   The final design must look "considerably different" than Lab 5; do **not** just change CSS values.  You need to totally alter the styles and target different elements in the HTML.  

## Step 3: Upload your work

When you are done with your webpage, close everything and use your FTP software to access your account on **csc170.org** and upload your **lab06** folder.

-   In a web browser, go to this address to check your handiwork:  
    **csc170.org/accountname/lab06/start.html**  
    (where “*accountname*” is your account name)

Remember: All files and folder names must always be all lowercase and no spaces.

## Step 4: Report your work

-   Remember: Use the W3C HTML validator (**https://validator.w3.org/**) AND the W3C CSS validator (**http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator**) to check your work before you report it!
-   In our Blackboard section, in Lab 6, post a link to your webpage to receive credit for this Lab.
